					<h2>Who we are</h2>
					<p><strong>UNES</strong> Tower atop Derryberry Hall, featuring a clock on each of its four sides, a carillon system, and the Golden Eagle. Designed to be aesthetically pleasing, but also functional, the towers primary purpose was to house the clock and carillon sound system, keeping time for campus and students. During a renovation of Derryberry Hall in the 1960s that made it much of what we see today, the iconic Eagle was moved from the tower on Jere Whitson to Derryberry Hall.<br><br>

					Now known as Kittrell and Bartoo Halls. These were original dorms – the women in the East and the men in the West. That’s the closest men and women lived to each other until 1996 when the first coed residence hall was built.
